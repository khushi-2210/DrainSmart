# DrainSmart 

**DrainSmart** is a civic-tech platform designed to map and predict water-logging hotspots across Delhi using GIS-based visualization and data-driven risk analysis.

## Problem
Delhi experiences severe water-logging during monsoons due to inadequate drainage planning and lack of proactive risk assessment at the ward level.

## Solution
DrainSmart integrates rainfall, drainage, and urban infrastructure data to:
- Identify ward-wise water-logging risks
- Visualize hotspots on an interactive map
- Support proactive municipal decision-making
- Improve citizen awareness and safety

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Vite, TailwindCSS, Lucide React(icons) 
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- Data & Analytics: Static ward-level risk data (JSON, mock data), Designed for future integration with GIS and analytics pipelines
- Tools & Platform: Git & Github, VS code, npm

## Future Scope
- Interactive GIS maps using Leaflet.js / Mapbox
- Spatial database integration with PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- Predictive analytics using Python-based rainfall models
- Real-time alerts and citizen reporting
